# Developer README

## Origin
After some research, I stumbled upon [this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/discussions/5082) proposal, which is continued by Calinou [here](https://github.com/Calinou/godot-demo-projects/blob/add-first-person-shooter/3d/first_person_shooter/enemy/enemy.gdshader).


Uses shaders to achieve directional billboard effect.

Some sample sprites:

## Icons
Icons were originally made with [Graphite](https://editor.graphite.rs/), but moved to Inkscape. Read [Creating Icons](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/editor/creating_icons.html) for info on how to add icons to custom node types.

Foc custom node icons, used the existing icons:
- [Sprite3D](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/icons/Sprite3D.svg)
- [AnimatedSprite3D](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/icons/AnimatedSprite3D.svg)
- [Sprite2D](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/icons/Sprite2D.svg)
- [AnimatedSprite2D](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/icons/AnimatedSprite2D.svg)


Then added parts of [DirectionalLight3D](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/icons/DirectionalLight3D.svg).
